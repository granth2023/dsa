//linear search is what? how is a for loop linear? what about finding a value wihtin an array for loop is linear? 

// what are some characteristics of a linear search? 

//why o of n? 

//can they be done on sorted or unsorted? why? 

// can binary be done on sorted or unsorted? why? 

// first, get the starting index and ending index of a collection -- how do we do that? 

function binarySearch(){


    //how do we finthe midpoint by adding idnexes together and diving by 2? 


    //how do we write the fact that while we have no found the element and not exhauseted the serach

    // how do we serach to the left of the midpoint? to the right? 

    //why repeat athe midpoint calucalition start and end index over 2? 

    //how do we return the idnex if found? if not how do we return the bitwise not of the start index?
