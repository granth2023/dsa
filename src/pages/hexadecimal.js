    how does 16 base work? 

    how does 0 in hexadecmial and binary work? what is 0? 

    how does a number work? how does it work? a number is 2 based and there are 8 slots so to work backwards we need a number -- 128 is the max? 

    because 2 to the 4th is 16, 2 hexdecimal digits represent 1 byte, one hexdecimal digit reprsetn 4 bits  

what is 17 in hexadecimal? 16 to the first plus 16 to the zero 

what is one in hexa ? 16 to zero    
what is two? 2 ""
but how does it look binary? 

remember a 16 to the zero is broken down with 2 to the 0 1 2 3 4 so to get to two is 0010 in hexacedimaly and binary 

so three is 0011
so four is 0100 

wha t is nine -- 16 to the zero and its 1001
10 is 1010

12 is 1100
15 is 1111 

what is 241
so if you need to go past 15 you now go into a seccond four squad you need to do 16 to the first and if we rememebr it goes back to 0 - 9 then the letters 

so what would it be to 241? 

you need at least 16 to 
which is 2 to 45,6,7,

so it would be 

1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1

what number is this? 

// think of it as directing
