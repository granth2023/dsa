    how does 16 base work? 

    how does 0 in hexadecmial and binary work? what is 0? 

    how does a number work? how does it work? a number is 2 based and there are 8 slots so to work backwards we need a number -- 128 is the max? 

    because 2 to the 4th is 16, 2 hexdecimal digits represent 1 byte, one hexdecimal digit reprsetn 4 bits  

what is 17 in hexadecimal? 16 to the first plus 16 to the zero 

what is one in hexa ? 16 to zero    
what is two? 2 ""
but how does it look binary? 

remember a 16 to the zero is broken down with 2 to the 0 1 2 3 4 so to get to two is 0010 in hexacedimaly and binary 

so three is 0011
so four is 0100 

wha t is nine -- 16 to the zero and its 1001
10 is 1010

12 is 1100
15 is 1111 

what is 241
so if you need to go past 15 you now go into a seccond four squad you need to do 16 to the first and if we rememebr it goes back to 0 - 9 then the letters 

so what would it be to 241? 

you need at least 16 to 
which is 2 to 45,6,7,

so it would be 

1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1

what number is this? 

why do we do this? 
hexadecimal makes binary nums more human dreadbale? 

wifi address: F0:C3:71:53:12:6D
what number is this hexideciaml 

what else has hexidcecimal? do error codes? 
what about addresses? 

what about CSS? 

what is rgb ? what is a 1 byte hex? does it represent ad decimal number from 0-255? 

what does rgb represent? 

how do we make a color set that has values of each byte in the hex color from 00 up to ff 

what does a 255, 0 0  in #? ff is 255, all red what is red? what is green? what is blue? what would yellow be? what would light blue? what about pink? 

how does emre do it? 

what number is this? 

11110001

what color is this? ##FF0000

today we are learning how to read binary -- why? read wifi addresses? its the language of computer memory? it's data

today we will learn to read that 
we want to read it because it is how computer memory represents data -- at its core 
if we can begin to understand the foudnation of the computer, we can work our way up from the bottom. 
so
binary numbers 

// think of it as directing 
directing is a perfomrance - teaching-- explain-- director 

what is base-10?
1 2 8 
10 square plus 10 to the first plus 10 to the zero 

what is base 2? does it make sense to call it binary? 

so is its base -2 and not 10 what is our base? what replace 10? 

how do we get to 128

how much is a byte? MENTION EARLIER

why is this 128? 

how do we get 43? 

again why? mention earlier! 

networking
character sets
optical storage
processing? 
file encoding
digital audio
displays/images/video 

i spent about 3 hours in the morning and another 2 in the evening 
im taking hours this week 

what about ip address -- four dot seperated bytes? how many is that? 
how do we find the binary representation of 10.0.119.42

what about character sets? 
what is ascii 
what about the english alphabet-- how is that reprsented
how many bits? how many characters? how many printable? any edge cases? 
what is A? 
lets watch this video? 

what is hexadecimal? 

what is base 2? what is base 10? what is base -16? 

how do we represent? 
why do we use 16

how is the same as 2 or 10? 

so what are the palce in 16? 

so what do the digits of a hexadecimal represent? 
what makes up 1 byte? 
how many bits make up a byte? 
what is 17? 
why is 17? 

what is hexadecimal? 
what is binary? 

binary is 8 
or two hexadecimal 

one hexadecimal represnts 4 digits 
1 is the same as 0001 

16 to the zero is 1
so to get to 1 we need the first four powers of 2 and only need the first one for 1 

to get to 17 

we need the 1 
and then the first digit in the second hexa which is 16 so the fifth power of 2 


what is 10 in hexadecimal? a


css color
what is rgb stand for? 
what are the numbers stand for 
what is 255? is the the number the highest? 
about about lowest? 
how about that in hex? what does that look like? how do we represnt 255 in hex? 

still need more prep! 

are they values? what are they expressed in? what is base 16? how is it represented? what is a hexadecimal? 
how many hours can I log? 
2 hours thinking about contract started on february 26 so ill log 20




where is base-2?
