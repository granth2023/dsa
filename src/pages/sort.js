<h4>
why sort? 
is it easier to add things to remove and find things? 
how do sort files in our folder? 

How many possible ways could we sort something? 
can we sort by runtime complexity? what did we do? 
what about space? 
what is comparison? distribution? stable? unstable? 

What is a comparison sort? what are some ways to compare two items? How could we decide to go first? 
is there a difference in terms of categorization between z-a or a-z? 


What is distribution? WHAT ARE SOME TYPES? HOW CAN WE SORT BY USING A PROPERTY OF AN ITEM TO DECIDE HOW TI SHOULD BE SORTED?

What is stable? why might we consider something preserving the relative order of a collected as stable?

what is stable versus unstbale? what is STABLE VERSUS unstable
