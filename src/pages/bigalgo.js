level up: 
example one: what is the time complexity? you have a sum of the array at each index then for each element you're mulitplying that so its o(n)? why? 

two: loop in a loop that expotential!! 
three: careful, two arary so they multiple so thats n times m 

four is the the same
    what is equivalent ot O(N)
    o(2n)
what are all the terms for classifciation? what is time complexity? what is space complexity?

what is space? why do vast majority of data structures hav ea space complexity of O (N)?

what is O (n)?

what is o1? 
how do you describe the nature of space taken up in a computer and the size of data? 



What is factorial complexity? 
what is is ti called hwen every solution must be correctly outputed to be determined? what is an example of this? 

if it takes 1 second for 100 items? how long? 


what is power of 2 complexity? (O(2^N))
what is power of two? how does input affect? what is a fibonacci? 

what is log linear complexity? 
how does input grow? what are sorts for this? merge? time? heap? if it takes 1 item 1 second, 100 items? 300 seconds
what are runtimes? 
what is a multi part algo? how does it deal with multiple data sets? do we add or multiply runtimes? when? 
the more data you ahve, the longer it iwll take to run the log 

why add them if its a do this then wehn done do that

how is runtime influenced by sieze of arr and arr  how do we big o represent this or how do we abstrac?

when do we multiply? 
why is it when we do this for each time you do that then mulitply? 

why do we multiplate when we iterate through arr b for every time in arr A 

why multiple when we iterate through a for every item in a 

so is it arr a times arr a or arr squared?
what do we do with the b  array? do we add that? what is the abstraciton? 

third example of this multiply runtimes 


what are dropping non dominant terms? 
--once youre in the quadrtic it sover


what is quadratic complexity? 
O(N^2) 

how is input affected? is it efficent? examples? why quick, buble, and insertion? 
nested loops? 

1 item = 1 second
100 items = ? 

how is looping through 2 d array? how is this code doing that? 


what is logarithimc complexity? 
O(log(N))
hwo does input growth affect process time? 
why half? 
are they efficient? 
what are examples? 
why binary search? 
why a guess teh number? 
you are taking things out fo the equation-- its like an algorithim where you are taking away from the total even when you guess wrong

if it takes 1 second for 1 item,s how long for 100 items? 

it processes increases half of what it was previously used?
16 million to 1 in 24 iterations


what are droping constants? 
does the amount of code matter for the same data? 
what is the point of big o in realtion to here? 
in big o does it matter if they arent the same? 
why does it matter how it scales? 
what about the data is different? nothing so it scales the same
150N is the same as N why? 
its all scaling the same 


what is linear complexity? 
O(N)
how does input effect the pace? 
is this considered efficeint? 
examples? 
why searching an array? 
why on all ements? 
what about inserting single things into existing data? 
is downloading? 

if it takes 1 second to process 100 items takes how long? 

what is constnat complexity? 
0(1)
how does the input matter? 
will it take the same time? 

what are some expamples? 
why add or remove single elements? 
why on one digit? 

if it takes item 1 second to process, how long would 100 items? 

what's a code exmpale ?

what is big o? 
how do we describe efficiency of an algorithim? 
how many cpu cycles does it take vs actual amount of time it takes vs how many iterations? 
what does big o meausre? does it account of r small picture or unit of measurement? what metric is it concerned with? how is it for detail? 
what is a runtime? 
how do we judge exactly what makes an lgorithm faster slower and more or less space efficient than a similar algo? how does it improve our decisions? 

what is the best case version? 
is it lucky to get omega? 

what is representation for expectated case? what symbol? 


what are alogirithms
how do we achieve a goal or solve? show oven 


Emre lecture

what is an algo? why a series of steps? how do we use big o? on it? 

what makes an algo inefficient? does a loop help? 

worst caase scenario while making a pie? checking oven? 

what are different types of Big O? 

what is most efficeint? what amkes o1 the most? 
what about o log n ? 

what happens when you increase in put data? 

what is cracking the code? 

what does big o concern itsle with? 

what is the big o? 

what is the big o for the function? 
how long does a function to run? 
what are measuring? how long does it take? how much spacae does it take? 

why does big o matter? what do we want tos ay about our code 

what is the worst case scenario? 

what is the best case scenario expressed as? 

what is expected case? what are sorting and search algo? 

are mergre sort data sort out of date? are they good way of testing ability of engineer? 

are there libaries that do this stuff? is search writing normal for early engineer? 

what is worst case? 

what is constnat complexity? what is an example? how many input, does it matter? 
what is a queue? first in first out? why is it 01? is it always the same ? 
what about stack? top? 
what is the time it takes n to do? 

whats an example? 

does it matter how large array is? 

what is o of n complexity 
what happens to size of time as input goes?
