// how do they self baalance? how do you calculate the difference in ehights between left side and right side fo the root? What is the threshold to know if the trees needs to be rebalanaced? 

//how does a AVL Tree know its height? How do we stores the height of the node as a property of a node? What is the ehight defined as? Is it distance from the most distant leafe below? Where does it make sense to place counter? Why is it on the left and right child nodes off the root? 

//When do we calcualte? How do we determine if a property needs incremenation or decremantation? If it needs it, how do we compare it to its sibling and evalue if the tree is balanced? How do we balance?
