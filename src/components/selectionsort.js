    while unsorted: how do we search iteratively through the unsorted part of data and find the lowest value? How do we swap the smallest value found with the first element of the unsorted segment? 
    //is this the lowest value? 
    is this the lowest value? 
    no. 
    is this the lowest value? 
    no. 
    Is this? 
    Yes. 
    
    Why is this the worst? 
    
     What is the time complexity? What is the space complexity? What is the stability? What type of sort is this?
